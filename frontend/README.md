# Smart Cache System is a highly intelligent, self-refining AI assistant built using:

- React (Vite)
- FastAPI (Python)
- Groq API (Llama-3 Models)
- Firebase (Firestore Database)
- AI Evaluator / Judge Logic
- 

# The project is designed to provide:

- Blazing fast AI responses
- Reduced API costs through smart caching
- Continuous self-improvement via an AI Judge
- Custom knowledge injection without heavy vector databases
- A seamless, premium, and distraction-free user interface

# Features

## AI Chat Assistant

AuraCache can answer complex questions dynamically using advanced models openai/gpt-oss-20b & openai/gpt-oss-120b. It provides formatted, easy-to-read Markdown responses directly in a sleek, minimalist UI.

---

## Smart Caching & Self-Refining AI (The Judge)

Smart Cache System doesn't just store answers; it evaluates them:

- It checks Firebase for a previously saved answer to your exact question.
- It concurrently fetches a fresh answer from a fast LLM.
- A massive "Judge" LLM compares the cached answer vs. the new answer.
- If the new answer is better, it automatically overwrites the Firebase database to ensure the cache gets smarter over time.

---

## Minimalist Professional UI

The frontend is built for enterprise-grade elegance:

- Creamy off-white editorial background.
- Floating, borderless input field.
- Seamless scrolling with hidden scrollbars.
- Real-time Markdown rendering for code blocks, lists, and headers.
